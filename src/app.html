      Our design helps the viewer visualize shot location and conversion on a regulation sized soccer goal post. <br><br> 

      Each shot is denoted by a point drawn on the goalpost. <br> 
      <span style="color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline">Red</span> points are used to visualize shots that ended up in goal, while <br> 
      <span style="color: #222222; text-decoration: underline"">Black</span> points are used for shots that were saved or were off-target. <br><br> 
      
      The <span style="text-decoration: underline"">opacity</span> of a point denotes its xG statistic. xG, or eXpectedGoals, is a popular metric used to measure the likelihood of scoring from a shot. <br> 
      Easier chances have higher xG (more solid), while harder chances have lower xG (more transparent).<br><br> 

      You can start by selecting a team. By default all available data is displayed, but you can choose to filter based on season (year) and shot type. 
      <br><br> 
      The chart on the right corresponds with the team/season/shot type chosen and shows the number of shots that have certain characteristics. <br><br>
      Time = minute interval that the shot was made during the game
      <br><br>
      Technique = how the shot was made
      <br><br>
      Body Part =  what part of a body was used to make the shot
